/* INSTRUCTIONS

Write a functioning program in C that, upon execution, prints the following on the screen: "Hello everybody!", followed by a newline character \n after the exclamation point. After printing, the program closes itself.

Hint:
Everything required for creating the program can be found in the example program in Chapter 2. Once you have understood the operating principle of the example, it should be easy to write your program. You do not need any boxes or variables in this program.


Example output:
Hello everybody!

*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // prints the message "Hello everybody!" to the console
    printf("Hello everybody!\n");

    // indicates successful completion of the program
    return 0;
}
