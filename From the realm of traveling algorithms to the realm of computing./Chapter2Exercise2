#include <stdio.h>

/*  INSTRUCTIONS
Write a program that prompts the user for an integer, calculates the square and prints the result on the screen (also print out a newline character \n after the result). After printing, the program closes itself.
Hint:
The program can be written in quite much the same way as the example in the chapter. You can implement the program in many ways, but you will probably need two variables: one for the number entered by the user and one for the square. In the example, the addition operator + was used for calculating a sum. In this program, you need the multiplication operator *.
Example output:
Enter an integer: 11
The square of the number you entered is 121
*/

int main()
{
    int input_number, squared_number;

    // prompt user to enter an integer
    printf("Enter an integer: ");

    // read the integer entered by the user and store it in input_number
    scanf("%d", &input_number);

    // calculate the square of the input number and store it in squared_number
    squared_number = input_number * input_number;

    // print the calculated square with a message
    printf("The square of the number you entered is %d\n", squared_number);

    // indicate successful completion of the program
    return 0;
}
